      <h2>WHY DID WE CREATE THIS?</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 1.12rem; font-family: sans-serif">
        Well, we had to build some project for our practicum, so we thought why
        not solve a day to day problem in our life through our project? Can you
        imagine how irritating it is for a student to go the timetable, find
        appropriate class, open the appropriate class room and then ultimately
        join the meet? It may not seem to others, but it is very frustating for
        the students who face that every single day! So we decided to combine
        all the class links into one, which will take you to the appropriate
        google meet with the click of a button. So why not leave the hassle of
        finding the appropriate class to the computer while the students can
        concentrate on their studies peacefully. üòå

      <h2>HOW DID WE DO THIS?</h2>
      <p style="font-size: 1.12rem; font-family: sans-serif">
        Well, first thing was to collect the data as much as it was possible for
        us. All the google meet links, the start time and end time of every
        class, the faculty names and the subject names. then we stored all the
        data in an array and programmed a JS script in which we import the time
        at which our website is opened and then according to that we check which
        class must be going on right now and then re-direct the user to the
        required link within 5 seconds(which we provided to the user for reading
        the class and faculty name of the class they will be taken to).
